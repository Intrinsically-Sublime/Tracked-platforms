---Description---

Based on Olalla's Catipillator v1.1 track system.

Tracks are 150% the width of Olalla's originals
Tracks are 95% the length of Olalla's originals
The sprockets are 150% the width of Olalla's originals (re-designed)
The sprockets are 47.5% the diameter of Olalla's originals (re-designed)
Instructions

To make one 100mm wheel base track you need:

19 - track v2
2 - sprocket v2
2 - 608 sprocket v2

I used Bamboo Cooking Skewers as hinge pins. 

Version 1

Unless you plan on making the turtle shell later I recommend using thingiverse.com/thing:10925 as it is the culmination of the lessons learnt here.

100mm wheelbase tank chassis based around Skimbals High Power Turtle Racers drive train. And my Koopa Shell Tank thingiverse.com/thing:10771

This is just the test jigs I made to test the track system for my Koopa Shell tank. I designed them to be a stand alone chassis system as to not be a waste.

Includes a modified version of Skimbals transmission. (Not needed unless you are using a 35mm diameter motor)
Larger motor mount.
Motor rotated to allow larger motor without hitting the track.

The pictures show a few generations. The stl files create the version pictured in the renderings. (motors are both in the center) I have printed them, I just haven't assembled them yet.

Version 2

100mm wheelbase tank chassis and transmission system loosely based on Skimbals High power Turtle Racers drive train. And my Koopa Shell Tank thingiverse.com/thing:10771

This is the culmination of what I have learnt designing:
thingiverse.com/thing:10924
thingiverse.com/thing:10771

Motors are now inside the tracks for better balance.
The transmissions are now an integral part of the chassis.
Larger Motor mount.

I have marked it as a work in progress because it has not been tested but it should be finished as it stands now.

This is not compatible with the previous versions.

Parts Marked MB are split for Makerbot owners
